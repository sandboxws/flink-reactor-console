# FlinkReactor for VS Code

Editor support for [FlinkReactor](https://flink-reactor.dev) — the React-style
TSX DSL that synthesizes to Flink SQL and Kubernetes `FlinkDeployment` CRDs.

This extension is the **client shell**: it brings FlinkReactor's semantic layer
into VS Code and automates the setup that otherwise blocks the editor tooling.

## Features

- **Live diagnostics** — the `@flink-reactor/language-server` synthesizes your
  `pipelines/*/index.tsx` in the background and publishes `FR`-prefixed problems
  (schema typos, orphaned sources, invalid connectors, changelog-mode
  mismatches) inline, with no terminal round-trip.
- **One-click ts-plugin setup** — adds `@flink-reactor/ts-plugin` to your
  `tsconfig.json` (comment-preserving, undoable) so JSX-nesting checks and
  ranked completions light up inside `tsserver`.
- **Workspace TypeScript prompt** — offers to switch VS Code onto your project's
  TypeScript, which the ts-plugin requires to load.
- **Project awareness** — discovers the nearest `flink-reactor.config.ts`, the
  `@/` alias, and your pipelines.
- **Editor surface** — a status bar item, an output channel, a Getting Started
  walkthrough, and starter snippets (`frpipeline`, `frsource`, `frsink`,
  `frtransform`, `frschema`).

## The two-server model

A FlinkReactor `.tsx` file is served by **two** language services at once, with
no overlap by construction:

| Server | Runs in | Owns |
|--------|---------|------|
| **`tsserver` + `@flink-reactor/ts-plugin`** | TypeScript's language service | JSX nesting validity (code `90100`), context-aware completions, type errors |
| **`@flink-reactor/language-server`** | a separate Node process (this extension is its LSP client) | synthesis-backed diagnostics — every `FR`-prefixed code |

The ts-plugin only activates when (1) it is listed in `tsconfig.json` **and**
(2) VS Code uses your **workspace** TypeScript — the bundled VS Code TypeScript
refuses workspace plugins for security. This extension automates both.

## Getting started

1. Open a FlinkReactor project (one containing `flink-reactor.config.ts`).
2. Run **FlinkReactor: Configure ts-plugin in tsconfig.json** (or accept the
   prompt).
3. Run **FlinkReactor: Use Workspace TypeScript Version** and reload.
4. Open a `pipelines/<name>/index.tsx` and start editing.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `FlinkReactor: Configure ts-plugin in tsconfig.json` | Ensure the ts-plugin, `jsxImportSource`, and `jsx` are set |
| `FlinkReactor: Use Workspace TypeScript Version` | Set `typescript.tsdk` to the workspace TypeScript and reload |
| `FlinkReactor: Restart Language Server` | Restart the synthesis language server |
| `FlinkReactor: Show Output` | Open the FlinkReactor output channel |

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `flinkReactor.enable` | `true` | Master switch for the language server |
| `flinkReactor.diagnostics.enable` | `true` | Publish synthesis-backed diagnostics |
| `flinkReactor.server.debounce` | `300` | Debounce (ms) after the last edit before re-synthesizing |
| `flinkReactor.server.timeout` | `5000` | Per-synthesis isolation timeout (ms) |
| `flinkReactor.server.maxHeapMb` | `512` | Heap ceiling (MB) for the synthesis worker |
| `flinkReactor.flinkVersion` | _(unset)_ | Target Flink version override |
| `flinkReactor.tsPlugin.autoConfigure` | `prompt` | `prompt` / `always` / `never` for tsconfig editing |
| `flinkReactor.cliPath` | _(empty)_ | Path to the `flink-reactor` CLI (reserved for CLI integration) |

## Packaging

The `.vsix` is self-contained: the extension host is bundled with esbuild
(`dist/extension.js`), and the language server is vendored under `server/` by
`scripts/prepare-server.mjs`. At runtime the extension prefers the server install
in your project's `node_modules` (so diagnostics match the DSL version your
project depends on) and falls back to the bundled copy.

```bash
pnpm build           # bundle the extension host
pnpm prepare-server  # vendor the language server into server/
pnpm package         # produce a .vsix (vsce --no-dependencies)
pnpm test            # unit tests (vitest)
pnpm test:e2e        # @vscode/test-electron end-to-end suite
```
